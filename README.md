# ServerPigeon
**A homing pigeon for your guild to PC.**

This Discord bot will interact with your dedicated server PC to give members easy access to powering on or off the server PC, starting and closing a server, and getting a list of all available server hosting softwares. For admins a command to shut down the server PC in the event of a power-threatening event, such as a thunderstorm. Using this command currently dubbed **`STORMOFF`**, only an admin can turn it back on; no other member can turn it on to protect against those who may not know of the current situation where the server PC is located.

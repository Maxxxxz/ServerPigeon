# ServerPigeon
**A homing pigeon for your guild to PC.**

This Discord bot will interact with your dedicated server PC to give members easy access to powering on or off the server PC, starting and closing a server, and getting a list of all available server hosting softwares. For administrators, there is a command that will disallow users from interacting with the PC in any way.

Intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with wireless/lan capabilities.
